I am a roboticist interested in robot dynamics and fundamental developments in dual quaternion algebra. I have been working in robotics for over eight years now and have significant experience with both theoretical and practical applications.

Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Robotics at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/) (TUM - Germany), and I am researching dynamic modeling and control using dual quaternion algebra. I am also a member of the [Munich Institute of Robotics and Machine Intelligence](https://www.mirmi.tum.de/mirmi/home/) research group (MIRMIR).


I received my BS degree (2015) in Control and Automation Engineering, my MS degree (2017) in Electrical Engineering, and my Ph.D. (2022) degree in Electrical Engineering from [UFMG](https://ufmg.br/).
