I am a roboticist interested in robot dynamics and fundamental developments in dual quaternion algebra. I have been working in robotics for over eight years now and have significant experience with both theoretical and practical applications.

Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in Robotics at the [Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais](https://ufmg.br/) (UFMG - Brazil), and I am researching the dynamic modeling and control of tilt-rotor UAVs using dual quaternion algebra. I am also a member of the Mechatronics, Control, and Robotics research group (MACRO).


I received my BS degree (2015) in Control and Automation Engineering, my MS degree (2017) in Electrical Engineering, and my Ph.D. (2022) degree in Electrical Engineering from [UFMG](https://ufmg.br/).
