I am a roboticist interested in robot dynamics and fundamental developments in dual quaternion algebra. I have been working in robotics for over eight years now and have significant experience with both theoretical and practical applications.

I am a Marie Curie Fellow at the University of Manchester, where I develop the Reconfigurable Robots for Inhospitable Environments (REINE) project under the UKRI Horizon Europe guarantee funding (EP/Y024508/1). The project aims to propose modeling and control strategies for modular self-reconfigurable robots with applications to nuclear decommissioning.


I received my BS degree (2015) in Control and Automation Engineering, my MS degree (2017) in Electrical Engineering, and my Ph.D. (2022) degree in Electrical Engineering from [UFMG](https://ufmg.br/).
